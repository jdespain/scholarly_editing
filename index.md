Students in Dr. Jessica DeSpain's Spring 2022 English 496 course at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville identified neglected texts to recover using Hathi Trust's [Collection of Nineteenth-Century British Periodicals](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/mb?a=listis;c=112818895). This site showcases their editions along with transcriptions of their transcribed texts encoded with Markdown and their supporting apparatuses.
