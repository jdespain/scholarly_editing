INTRODUCTION

“Dirge for a Dead Painter” was written by Miss Jewsbury. It was published in The Athenaeum, a British literary periodical, on January 28, 1832. It was reprinted in a latter edition of the issue on April 21, 1832.

	

BIOGRAPHY

Maria Jane Jewsbury, AKA Miss Jewsbury or M. J. J., was born on 25 October 1800 in Measham, Derbyshire.  She was the eldest of six children and the daughter of coal mine owner and cotton manufacturer Thomas Jewsbury.  Her mother, Maria Smith, was herself artistically inclined, and likely encouraged Maria Jane in her writing.  At any rate, Maria Jane wanted to be a writer from a young age.  She later wrote to friend and fellow poet Felicia Hemans that “I was nine years old when the ambition of writing a book, being praised publicly, and associating with authors seized me with a vague longing” (Jewsbury, quoted in Jump 181).  Jewsbury attended a boarding school in Shenstone, Staffordshire until she was fourteen, when a severe illness prevented her from returning to school and ultimately marked the end of her formal education.  She was undeterred from her dreams of becoming an author, however, and would stay up late writing poems, planning stories, and starting work on a play.  At seventeen she published a satirical poem titled “Curiosity and Scandal” in the Coventry Herald, a local newspaper.  

When her mother died two years later, Jewsbury was tasked with taking care of her siblings.  She later described this time in her life as “a life so painfully, so laboriously domestic that it was an absolute duty to crush intellectual tastes...I could neither write nor read legitimately till the day was over” (Jewsbury, quoted in Jump 181).  She continued to publish poetry in newspapers and annuals, however, and the editor of the Manchester Courier, Alaric Watts, introduced her to a firm of London publishers who agreed to publish a two-volume collection of her work, titled Phantasmagoria; or, Sketches of Life and Literature, anonymously.  In the opening poem, Jewsbury dedicated the collection to William Wordsworth, and she also sent a copy to him.  Two days later, he sent her a letter thanking her and praising her prose works, which he liked better than her poetry, although he also praised her poems “To Love” and “To Death.”  He liked the collection so much that he sent a copy to poet laureate Robert Southey, without realizing that one of the prose pieces, “First Efforts in Criticism,” included a parody of Southey’s review style.  Southey noticed the parody and replied that “the best service [he] could render to the misguided young person was to leave her wholly unnoticed” (quoted in Jump 183).  

The Wordsworths, however, became close friends with Jewsbury; she was particularly close with Dora Wordsworth, William’s daughter, who was four years younger than her.  One of Jewsbury’s most popular works, Letters to the Young, bears many similarities to a letter that she wrote to Dora in October of 1826 describing a religious experience she had.  Letters to the Young, published in 1828, is an evangelical advice manual that was extremely popular at the time of its publication, and remained so into the late 1870s.  In 1829, another volume of her poetry, Lays for Leisure Hours, was published.  She dedicated this collection to her friend and fellow poet Felicia Hemans.  Several of the poems explore the conflict between fame and peace of mind for female writers, a theme that would come up again in The Three Histories:  The History of an Enthusiast. The History of a Nonchalant. The History of a Realist, Jewsbury’s last full-length work, published in 1830.

Jewsbury’s anonymous contributions to The Athenaeum began in 1830, and she continued to publish works in that periodical until 1832.  Her anonymity allowed her to write with authority about other authors, praising Mary Wollstonecraft, Ann Radcliffe, and Joanna Baillie’s “masculine” rationality as opposed to the “feminine” elegance of her female contemporaries.  She also published an essay arguing for the merits of Percy Bysshe Shelley’s work at a time when Shelley was regarded as a dangerous eccentric.  

In 1832, Jewsbury married Reverend William Kew Fletcher, possibly out of financial convenience.  The couple travelled to India together, during which trip Jewsbury kept a journal and wrote a series of twelve poems known as the “Oceanides” documenting her moods over the course of the journey.  The poems and part of the journal were published in The Athenaeum.  Her last poem, “Ay, up with the tent pegs,” was written while in India.  She died of cholera in Poona on the way to Karnai on 4 October 1833.  Upon learning of her death, William Wordsworth published “Liberty,” a poem he wrote for her a few years before and included a note celebrating her life and achievements.  Other contemporaries mourned the loss of potential, believing she had barely accomplished anything, not realizing how much work she had actually produced.  The very anonymity that allowed her to express her opinions so freely in writing resulted in her work remaining largely unknown.



HISTORICAL CONTEXT

To understand the poem, one must understand the context surrounding the poem that exists. “Dirge for a Dead Painter” was written in memory of Henry Liverseege, a painter born in Manchester in 1803, and, as alluded to in the poem, suffered many health problems, including asthma, from an early age (“Henry Liverseege, Esq.” 52). By knowing more about Liverseege’s life, and his experience with illness, one can understand the language and tone of the poem. It is desperate and tragic, as Liverseege’s young death was. It is also important to note that “Dirge for a Dead Painter” would be remembered in connection with Liverseege. In 1874, Memorials of Manchester Streets was published, and included a section on Liverseege, including Jewsbury’s poem in its entirety. This was after her death as well (Proctor 160). 

Besides context about the poem itself, there are important events and people in Jewsbury’s life that situate her in a more understandable context for the average reader. One thing of note is Jewsbury’s connection to the Wordsworth family. As noted in the biography section, after publishing her collection of poems, Phantasmagoria, to William Wordsworth, he had quite wonderful things to say about some of the poems, and Jewsbury became friends with him and his family, especially his daughter, Dora. Some letters from Dora to Jewsbury are available to the public as part of a collection of Dora’s letters (Jump 183). This helps put Jewsbury into the community of poets during the time, along with her other associations. Besides her connection to the Wordsworths, Maria Jane Jewsbury was not the only member of her family involved with publishing. Her younger sister, Geraldine, was also a writer and an editor, specifically for The Athenaeum, the very journal in which she published not just “Dirge for a Dead Painter,” but also her most known work, “The Oceanides”, a series of poems.

There is also one thing of note regarding her post-humous career that affected our editing decisions. At the time of her death, she had been apparently planning to release a collected edition of her works (essays, reviews, and poems), but after her death, her husband refused to return her writings to her family, meaning those writings and manuscripts are lost (Jump 186). Thus, it is very important that we attempt to recover some of her work, as it was never truly given its chance in her time. 



ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

In terms of ethics, there are some considerations needed to keep in mind. First, we must acknowledge that Maria Jane Jewsbury was publishing her poems in The Athenaeum semi-anonymously, using “Miss Jewsbury” instead of her full name. Although it seems as though she was fine with people knowing who she was, we have decided to keep her name as Miss Jewsbury, as that was the name she wanted the poem attributed to. Another major ethical consideration was the regarding her manuscripts and writings. Because of her husband’s actions, we do not have access to her many of her original writings. This makes the process of recovery complicated, as we cannot go off a manuscript or other writings regarding the piece, as they are lost. Although this poem has been republished in at least one other place (as mentioned in the historical context section of the introduction), it has mainly been lost to time. We hope that with this edition we bring acknowledgment of Maria Jane Jewsbury’s works and voice, although her untimely death and husband’s actions led to her work being lost.



EDITORIAL DECISONS

For our edition, we have gone off the poem’s appearance in the Athenaeum, as no manuscript exists to the public, most likely due to Jewsbury’s husband refusing to return her writings. Many of our choices were informed by our ethical considerations. In terms of editing choices, we have standardized the spacing for readability, but have kept Jewsbury’s punctuation, capitalization, and spelling.  We have decided to keep Jewsbury’s name appearing as Miss Jewsbury for this poem, as that is what she wished to have it attributed to. In terms of footnotes, we have marked anything that needed context, whether that be historical, social, or otherwise. Included in this is word meanings that are uncommon today. These choices were made with the intent to keep the poem as faithful to the earliest version (and Jewsbury’s vision) as possible, while making it readable and accessible to modern readers.

DIRGE FOR A DEAD PAINTER.  
*A Tribute to the Memory of the late Henry Liverseege.*[^fn1]  
BY MISS JEWSBURY.[^fn2]  

DEATH, grim death, when shall we see  
{:.indent-}This broad earth no more thy city?  
GRAVE, deep grave, when shall it be  
{:.indent-4}Thou wilt close thy lips in pity?  
When shall love's subduing prayer,  
When shall genius, yet more rare,  
Mind and worth in blended beauty,  
Woo ye from your cold stern duty?  
When shall sweetness win back one?  
{:.indent-4}Never, never--he is gone!  

Yet, swift hunter, couldst not give  
{:.indent-4}Summons ere the hart was stricken?  
Grave, that on death's prey dost live,  
{:.indent-4}Could thy hungry silence quicken  
Into no foreboding knell  
Ere the unconscious victim fell?  
Could ye not give leave to plight  
Farewell, ere his day grew night?  
Might not sorrow's need have one?  
{:.indent-4}Ye were ruthless!  He is gone!  

Yesterday, scarce yesterday,  
{:.indent-4}Bright dreams through his brain were flowing,  
And his hand with cunning play  
To the world those dreams was showing.  
Yesterday, and in his eye  
Fame had writ her prophecy;  
Sealed it on his flexile[^fn3] lips,  
Now in dark and mute eclipse?  
Could not genius save her son?  
{:.indent-4}Wherefore question?  He is gone!  

Speak not of his fragile form,  
{:.indent-4}And his often painful pillow--[^fn4]  
What may longer bide the storm  
{:.indent-4}Than the delicate drooping willow?    
He was loved, and love can do    
Feats physicians never knew,  
With its boundlessness of care,      
Mighty hope, and fervent prayer:     
Hush, O hush--love's power is none--      
{:.indent-4}It is weeping!  He is gone!      

Dust to dust; now, dust to dust,  
{:.indent-4}And we leave his dwelling lowly;    
Not another sigh we must,  
{:.indent-4}If it be not meek and holy;  
Whose the arm that smote him down?  
Whose the hand took off his crown?--  
God, alone omnipotent,  
Calling back what he had lent--  
Come then, friends, and be each one  
{:.indent-4}Better Christians, now he's gone!
