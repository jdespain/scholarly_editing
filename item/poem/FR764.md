My Life had Stood - a Loaded Gun - 
In Corners - till a Day
The Owner passed - identified - 
And carried Me away - 

And now We roam in Sovreign Woods - 
And now We hunt the Doe - 
And every time I speak for Him
The Mountains straight reply - 

And do _I_ smile, such cordial light
Opon the Valley glow - 
It is as a Vesuvian[^1] face
Had let it's pleasure through -

And when at Night - Our good Day done - 
I guard My Master's Head - 
'Tis better than the Eider Duck's[^2] 
Depp Pillow - to have shared -

To foe of His - I'm deadly foe - 
None stir the second time - 
On whom I lay a Yellow Eye - 
Or an emphatic Thumb - 

Though  I than He - may longer live
He longer must - than I - 
For I have but the power to kill,
Without - the power to die - In Corners - till a Day
The Owner passed - identified - 
And carried Me away - 

And now We roam in Sovreign Woods - 
And now We hunt the Doe - 
And every time I speak for Him
The Mountains straight reply - 

And do I smile, such cordial light
Opon the Valley glow - 
It is as a Vesuvian face
Had let it's pleasure through -

And when at Night - Our good Day done - 
I guard My Master's Head - 
'Tis better than the Eider Duck's 
Depp Pillow - to have shared -

To foe of His - I'm deadly foe - 
None stir the second time - 
On whom I lay a Yellow Eye - 
Or an emphatic Thumb - 

Though  Ithan He - may longer live
He longer must - than I - 
For I have but the power to kill,
Without - the power to die -
