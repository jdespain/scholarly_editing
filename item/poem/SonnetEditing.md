## _SONNET_

- **I once** had thought to have embalm'd my name
- With Poesy:-to have serv'd the gentle Muses
- With high sincerity :-but Fate refuses,
- And I am now become most strangely tame,
- And careless what becomes of Glory's game-
- Who strives- who wins the wondrous prize- who 
- loses!
- Not that the heavy world my spirit bruises;
- But I have not the heart to rush at Fame.
- Magnificent and mental images
- Have visited me oftentimes, and given
- My mind to proud delights - But now it sees
- Those visions going like the lights of even:
- All intellectual grandeur dimly flees,-
- And I am quiet as the stars of heaven!
- {:.indent-4} **P.C.**
