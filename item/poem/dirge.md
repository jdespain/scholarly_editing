DIRGE FOR A DEAD PAINTER.  
*A Tribute to the Memory of the late Henry Liverseege.*[^fn1]  
BY MISS JEWSBURY.[^fn2]  

- DEATH, grim death, when shall we see  
- {:.indent-1}This broad earth no more thy city?  
- GRAVE, deep grave, when shall it be  
- {:.indent-1}Thou wilt close thy lips in pity?  
- When shall love's subduing prayer,  
- When shall genius, yet more rare,  
- Mind and worth in blended beauty,  
- Woo ye from your cold stern duty?  
- When shall sweetness win back one?  
- {:.indent-1}Never, never--he is gone!  

- Yet, swift hunter, couldst not give  
- {:.indent-1}Summons ere the hart was stricken?  
- Grave, that on death's prey dost live,  
- {:.indent-1}Could thy hungry silence quicken  
- Into no foreboding knell  
- Ere the unconscious victim fell?  
- Could ye not give leave to plight  
- Farewell, ere his day grew night?  
- Might not sorrow's need have one?  
- {:.indent-1}Ye were ruthless!  He is gone!  

- Yesterday, scarce yesterday,  
- {:.indent-1}Bright dreams through his brain were flowing,  
- And his hand with cunning play  
- To the world those dreams was showing.  
- Yesterday, and in his eye  
- Fame had writ her prophecy;  
- Sealed it on his flexile[^fn3] lips,  
- Now in dark and mute eclipse?  
- Could not genius save her son?  
- {:.indent-1}Wherefore question?  He is gone!  

- Speak not of his fragile form,  
- {:.indent-1}And his often painful pillow--[^fn4]  
- What may longer bide the storm  
- {:.indent-1}Than the delicate drooping willow?  
- He was loved, and love can do  
- Feats physicians never knew,  
- With its boundlessness of care,  
- Mighty hope, and fervent prayer:  
- Hush, O hush--love's power is none--  
- {:.indent-1}It is weeping!  He is gone!  

- Dust to dust; now, dust to dust,  
- {:.indent-1}And we leave his dwelling lowly;  
- Not another sigh we must,  
- {:.indent-1}If it be not meek and holy;  
- Whose the arm that smote him down?  
- Whose the hand took off his crown?--  
- God, alone omnipotent,  
- Calling back what he had lent--  
- Come then, friends, and be each one  
- {:.indent-1}Better Christians, now he's gone!
