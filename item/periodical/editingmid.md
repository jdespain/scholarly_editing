Not that the <span style="color:red"> heavy </span>  world my spirit bruises;  
 But<span style="color:red">  I have not the heart to rush at </span> Fame.  
Magnificent and <span style="color:red">mental </span> images  
Have visited me oftentimes, and given

## _Sonnet To Retirement_
I once had thought to have eblam'd my name  
With poesy —to have served the gentle Muses  
With high sincerity ;—but life refuses ;—  
And I am now become most strangely tame,  
And careless what becomes of glory's game—  
Who plays— who wins the wond'rous prize—  
who loses:  
Not that the jarring world my spirit bruises—  
But fate denies the Paradise of Fame!  
  
Magnificent and lustrous images  
Have visited me often—times, and given  
My mind to proud delights — But now it sees  
Those visions fading like the lights of Even';  
All intellectual glory dimly flees,  
And I am silent as the stars of Heaven!  
J.H. Reynolds.
