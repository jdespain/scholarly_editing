# Joe Upon Happiness by Fredrick Talbot edited by Lamonta Swarn and Adam Schroeder

## Textual History
Mary Elizabeth Braddon and husband John Maxwell who were both successful authors in the genre of sensationalism worked together to  create and edit what is now known as The Belgravia: A London Magazine. 
According to Gabriel, M. E. Braddon edited the Belgravia from 1866-1876. Her husband John Maxwell joining her in 1874. “Gabriele argues that each issue of Belgravia, which was named for the upscale London neighborhood, juxtaposed fiction with nonfiction journalism, poetry, advertising, and illustrations in order to “reproduce the fragmentation of urban modernity through the ephemeral associations created in the reader's mind by scattered findings about world exhibits, bric-a-brac treasures historical neighborhoods of London, satirical poetry, fashions of the day, installments of serialized novels, and episodic narratives contained in the advertisements” (61). Not only was M. E. Braddon the editor of the Belgravia, she also featured her own works in the magazine. She would incorporate her own writings while giving voice to new authors. For the actual text of Joe Upon Happiness, there was unfortunately no background and information on it other than the fact that it was released in the Belgravia. There was no evidence that the author had published it anywhere else other than the sensational magazine. 

## Authorial Biography
Attempting to recover this work has been extremely challenging due to having so little information surrounding the potential author and his reasoning behind most of his writing. There were a slew of names, or potential pseudonyms that our author went under. Most notably Fredrick Talbot. F. Talbot, Francis Talbot, and F.T were also names that he went under. He wrote in The Belgravia:  multiple times with works such as Jack Pugh's Legacy/ A Tale, His Second Inheritance, Lotte's Fortune, and best-known work, The Winning Hazard. 

## Ethical Considerations
We thought that Joe's character is supposed to be synonymous for racism and slavery. While this work was published in the mid 1870s, who know when the apparatus was written. In the story, Joe's character is a monkey who is introduced to the narrator about halfway through. The terms “monkey” and “tiny little fellow” are already problematic. If we take into consideration the context and time period, there are many suggestions that the author could have been referring to slavery and human auctions. While Joe's character is an animal, the narrator really plays into it. There are moments of blackmail and subtle mind control that are off-putting for the audience to read. Amongst the previous incidents, there is still a conversation going on. The narrator seems to talk down Joe, not just because he is an animal, but he is less than the narrator. It is possible that the narrator is supposed to be the condescending slave master talking to his enslaved people.Going along with the ideas of racism and inequality, we thought that Joe's character represented the uncanny. It is a different sort of uncanny, but expected and probable. This story creates a humorous uncanny instead of a fearful uncanny. Joe's character was a monkey, and monkeys are very close to humans (but not quite). This connection goes back to the possible connection to slavery. Enslaved people were people, but were not considered people in the eyes of white folks. Throughout the story, there is controversial jargon and rhetoric used in conversation between characters. For example, the phrase “hairy little fellow” is continuously used to demean and dehumanize who we can only assume to be a person of color. For this story it wasn't a question of whether this story was worth recovery or not, it was a question as to how aware were people of the blatant racism in literature at this point in time. 
The blatant and subtle nuances of language and how it played a role in reading material in the Victorian ages. This story needed to be made aware of, not because it was worth the read, but because of how intensely present the racism against people of color is in this short story. 

## Socio-Historical Context
During the time our story was published many events were occurring in The United Kingdom. 
The disestablishment and partial disendowment of the Irish church, accomplished in 1869 in face of the opposition of the House of Lords; the Irish Land Act of 1870, providing some safeguards to Irish tenant farmers; William Edward Forster's Education Act of the same year, the first national act dealing with primary education. 
The Irish Land Act of 1870 were steps taken in law to deal with tenancy contracts and peasant proprietorship of Irish lands in the 19th and 20th centuries. 
At this point in time the idea of owning land and Irish law making, as it is now, something important due to the fact that Ireland was and still is fighting for freedom from the British rule. 
The second act mentioned, the William Edward Forster's Education Act enforced the rules that schools be publicly funded, education must be provided to children at least between the ages of five and thirteen, and that schools must be regularly inspected to ensure it is safe and inhabitable to students as a learning environment. 
This is most like the laws we have now for education around the world, promoting literacy and pathways to higher education. 
Another tragically important point of this story is the heavy implication of the main character visiting a human zoo. 
In our research we discovered that the last human zoo exhibit was only in 1958 at the World's Fair in Brussels, Belgium. 
So during the time this story was released, human petting zoos would have still been a very prevalent part of entertainment throughout Europe. 
These human zoos were created to dehumanize black and African people through the eyes of the white Europeans. 
In Joe Upon Happiness, there are so many moments that we can only stare in the face the metaphor between being at a zoo speaking and trying to understand a monkey. 
Most often in the past black and African people were compared to primates because of our physical features. 
So for this story to anthropomorphize a monkey in this way, we can only assume that it is because of that correlation. 

## Editorial Rationale
We find it very interesting that a magazine such as The Belgravia would choose to withhold author names in their introductions of pieces. 
For example, with our story, Joe Upon Happiness, when it is introduced and featured, the authors name is not mentioned. 
His previous works were listed instead. 
Perhaps it is because of the way papers and magazines circulated in the Victorian era, but it is definitely a conscious choice on the part of the editor. 
This decision in turn could actually make the magazine more interesting because people are forced to look through previous magazines to find their favorite authors works and scavenger hunt for certain pieces that may be mentioned, but not featured in a particular issue. 
It is also very important to mention that in most issues of The Belgravia there are pictures and artwork as well. 
Most of them are what we can only assume to be renderings of moments in time of some of the stories featured in each issue. 
If we were the editors of this magazine and story, we would have included author names more often than every few issues and we would have made more of an effort to be aware of the content of each story.

# Story by Fredrick Talbot
## Joe Upon Happiness
'At one, by the monkey-house,'
cried my wife, one day during the
Christmas holidays, as I parted with 
her at the door of a carriage on the
Metropolitan, I being bound for the 
City, and she, with a party of chil-
dren, for the Zoo-- to use that de-[^1]
praved but convient abbreviation. 
'All right,' was my reply. In the 
end I was better than my word. I 
arrived at the gardens and found my-
self at the monkey-house whilst it 
yet wanted a quarter to one. 
I confess to a great dislike for
monkeys. I feel humiliated in their
presence; their antics fill me with a 
profound disgust. If they must be 
kept, I would have them kept in a 
pround seclusion, and only exhibit-
ed to criminals occasionally as warn-
ing. Usually therefore, when brought
into contact with these repulsive ani- 
mals, I confine my attentions to the 
least odious of the tribe, those pretty
hairy little fellows, for instance, that [^2] 
remind one rather of cats than men. 
I was standing by one of the smaller
cages watching the manoeuvres of a 
little fellow who was trying to draw
the tail of a brother monkey between
the bars of his cage. All at once a 
door opened just before me, and a 
stout good-humored-looking man 
appeared in the entrance to a half-
darkened room. 
'Would you like to see Joe, sir?' [^3]
he asked in a half whisper. 
Rather weakly I complied, not 
exactly knowing what he meant, and 
followed him into the room, starting 
back as I saw before me a hairy little 
dwarf who came shambling towards 
us Joe was the chimpanzee. 
He was dressed in a dust-coloured 
jacket made of a government blanket, 
a sort of 'jumper' or 'monkey-jacket,' 
in fact. 
'Shake hands, Joe, with the gen-
tleman,' said the keeper; and Joe 
shook hands. He had a nice soft 
palm, and he grasped my hand in 
what I should call a gentlemanly 
kind of way-- softly,and yet with 
cordiality. At this moment the 
keeper was called away, and left the 
room, saying that he would return in 
a moment and that Joe was quite 
harmless. For the instant I felt a little ner- 
vous; but putting the best face upon 
the matter, I resolved to take ad- 
vantage of this opportunity to make 
a critical examination of Joe's phy- 
sique. With a view to propitiate 
his opinion of me, I took from my 
pocket a nut- I had just bought a 
bag of them for the children- and 
offered it to Joe. He took it po- 
litely, turned it over in his fingers, 
regarded it in a melancholy manner, 
and returned it to me. 
'He doesn't like them, it appears,' 
I soliloquised out allowed. 'I wonder 
what he does like.' 
'Apples,' said Joe at once. 
You might have knocked me down 
with a feather. I looked at Joe 
earnestly; his countenance was un- 
changed. He did not seem to think 
that he had performed any wonderful 
feat. A violent tremor came over me, 
and I almost fainted. 'I must,' I 
said to myself, 'belabouring under 
some cerebral excitement, and have 
given to much rein to the fancy.' 
Still, I would test the matter again. 
'*Do* you like apples, Joe?' I said 
once more.
Joe nodded his head, but made no 
other reply. 
'Ah, I thought you couldn't speak, 
my fine fellow!' I cried. 
'I can though,' exclaimed Joe. 
This time I could not doubt the 
evidence of my senses. Wonderful 
as it might seem, I must accept it
as a fact. Joe could talk.
'But,' I said, 'Joe, how is it, if
you can talk, that you haven't talked
before?'
i had before heard of this as a 
traditional explaination of the silence
of monkeys, but I had believed it to
to be a foolish popular delusion.
''Cause you're a gentleman.'
I am pledged to a full and faith-
ful narrative of this extraordinary 
interview; otherwise I should hesi-
tate before I ventured to record 
Joe's flattering words. 
At this point I felt violent em-
barrassment seize upon me. A won-
derful opportunity had fallen to my
lot; such a chance as, so far as I 
knew, had never been afforded to any
human being. I was in direct com-
munication with one of the lower 
animals. Here was an opening that 
might lead me to an acquaintance 
with the inner life of the animal
world. And yet for the life of 
me I couldn't thinkof anything to
say. The field was so overpower-
ing in its vastness that I didn't know 
where to begin, and fell back in de-
spair on the commonplace. I cannot
adequately describe to you the mor-
tification I experienced when I found
that I was unequal to the grand oc-
casion that had presented itself, that
I could only repeat my former ques-
tion in an affirmative shape. 'So
you ^do^ like apples then, Joe?'
'Yes,' said Joe, between his teeth;
but with a melancholy shake of the
head, as if to say that even these
were vanity. Then I saw an oppor-
tunity of raising our conversation to 
a higher level.
'Joe,' I said, 'are you happy?'
'What's that?' he replied.
I reflected for a moment.
'Being happy, Joe?' I said. 'Well,
look here Joe, you like apples'--
again those fatal apples; you see
that I couldn't soar beyond-'and 
you don't like nuts. Being happy 
is having all apples.
Joe shook his head.
'Taturs too,' said Joe, 'biled.'
'Well taturs or apples, whatever 
you like best. That's being happy.'
'Come make us happy, then,'
cried Joe.
And then it struck me that I was 
instilling into this poor animal's 
brain notions that were quite false 
and erroneous. I was angered too,
at having to talk to myself instead of
listening to Joe, and I was over-
whelmed with a sense of respon-
sibility I incurred, thus suddenly
made an organ of communication
between two phases of existence. I
felt, too, that in my desire to be
plain, I had been perilously loose in
my doctrine; looser even than the
utilitarian, or the other loose kind
of people- I forget their names-
and had placed happiness in mere 
sensual enjoyment. I might infect
the whole race of monkeys with this
most pernicious doctrine. I must
retract. And yet I knew not what
to substitute. 'Joe,' I said, hesi-
tating a little, 'it isn't taturs and
apples that make you happy- it's
going without them.'
Joe curled his lip, showing a com-
plicated set of teeth, and grunted in-
credulously. Then I was conscious 
that I had gone a little too far on the 
ascetic side. After all, a happiness 
that made him miserable wouldn't 
be of much use to Joe.
'Well, look here, Joe, suppose
that I offered you a hundred apples
to-morrow on condition that you
didn't any to-day--well, Joe?'
I said tentatively. 
'I wouldn't believe you,' cried Joe;
'lets have 'em now.'
I looked at Joe in despair. Time
was running on; any moment might
put this unparalleled interview to a
close, and in all the while, instead of
catechising Joe, he, it appeared, had
been questioning me. I felt as Co-
lenso might before the intelligent 
Zulu, as Atkins (I think the name
was) when he converting his
Carib wife (see Robinson Crusoe);
as a sophist might when he was 
tackled by Socrates. How should 
I instil into the mind of Joe true no-
tions as to happiness? Perhaps I
had better abandon the attempt, and
endeavour to extract from Joe some
information about himself and his
own feelings.
Were I other than a veracious
chronicler, I should here begin to
interpolate observations of my own.
I might cause Joe to fall foul of my
foes. I might bid him discourse of
all kinds of social topics. I might
turn him into a zoological Chester-
field, and make him disclose some
scandals about the elephant and the
rhinoceros. But white-robed Truth
holds up a warning hand, and I for-
bear. Joe's ideas I am compelled
to say, were very limited. I found
conversation difficult. Do what I
would I could not raise the tone of
the conversation above mere gastro-
nomic considerations. Beyond the
range of his stomach his notions
were few. He liked music, I found,
and thought he should enjoy riding
on the zebras, of whom he got occa-
sional glimpses. Except for a vague
discontent and restlessness, of which
he could give no account, he did not
seem unhappy. 
My soul burned within me to im-
part to him some of those ideas
which make the life of man so bright
and joyous; but I experienced an
insuperable difficulty in the poverty
of our mutual vocabulary, and I felt
more than doubtful whether, even if
I could make him understand, Joe
would approve of schemes that, whilst
providing for the future happiness
of man, exclude all consideration
for that of monkeys. All the while
Joe persistently tried to turn the
conversation to apples. When he
found that I meant only talk, and
that for all my fine words I had no-
thing in my pockets, Joe's face be-
came overclouded and his language
incoherent and insulting. I thought
that he would ahve sprung upon me
and bitten me; but fortunately at
this moment the keeper opened the
door and came in.
Joe instantly became silent, and
resumed his usual habit of stolid un-
concerned slightly tinged with melan-
choly. 
I looked at my watch, found that
it was just five minutes past the
hour, and hastened to the rendezvous,
where I found the children devouring
buns and eager to make the acquaint-
ance of the monkeys.
Alas, since the above was penned
Joe has departed from this trouble-
some world! The chance of ex-
changing ideas with the lower ani-
mals has been lost, and possibly for
cycles of ages may not recur. And
I, to whom the opportunity was once
given, have proved unworthy of it
for Joe, our regret is tempered by
the thought that his death must have
been something of a release. De-
prived of the freedom of the woods,
without a mate, without offspring,
life could have small happiness
for Joe. Perhaps, if he could have 
been set to work to turn a crank or
walk the treadwheel--alleviations
which society provides for human
beings of a like disposition to Joe--
he might have bad a better time of
it. For we are assured--usually by
those who have the fortunate knack 
of making other people work for
their advantage-- that labour is the
great sweetner of life and chief
source of happiness.
