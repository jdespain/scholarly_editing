## **Style Guide**
You will see that words have been color-coded in each version of the poem. These denote the textual variants made by Reynolds:   
- <span style="color:red">Red:</span> Word Choice
- <span style="color:green">Green:</span> Punctuation
- <span style="color:blue">Blue:</span> Spelling
- <span style="color:purple">Purple:</span> Capitalization  
- <span style="color:orange">Orange:</span> Line Indentation

Alongside the colored codes, you can find corresponding footnotes that further discuss the textual variations, as well as a hypothetical explanation of the authorial intention behind these changes and our interpretation of its alternative meanings.  

Additional footnotes provide either **biographical** or  **historical** or **literary** context, offering you the opportunity for deeper understanding and readings.
