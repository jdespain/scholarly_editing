# **Textual History**  
Before we narrow in on the textual history of “Sonnet for Retirement,” it may be helpful to begin with key information specific to Reynold’s literary style and the biographical context pertinent to the time when Reynold’s published the versions of his sonnet.  

### **A Romantic and Satirical Genuis**  

Reynolds's strongest genre was satire. Since childhood, he had written comic and satirical poetry, which for years he “regarded as pieces of diversion” (Jones 304). Reynolds's most familiar work is his satirical masterpiece _Peter Bell_, an “uproarious mockery of William Wordsworth’s faults and limitations” (Jones 304). Leonidas Jones, a well-versed scholar of Reynolds, explains that “satire always depends upon the reader’s knowledge of and interest in what is being satirized. All literate people have potential traces of malice and envy that Reynolds's iconoclasm appeals to in ridiculing in _Peter Bell_ the great poetic god Wordsworth” (Jones 305).  

Reynolds’s satirical approach and engagement with Romantic aesthetics are essential to keep in mind while reviewing the transcriptions and their provided footnotes.

The 1820 “Sonnet” is the first version of John Hamilton Reynolds's poem “Sonnet for Retirement.”
In 1820, written under one of his pseudonyms, Peter Corcoran, Reynolds published _The Fancy_, a spirited but “fictional” biography of Corcoran.

## 1832: _The Athenaeum_, “Sonnet for Retirement”  

![1832 sonnet](https://jdespain.github.io/scholarly_editing/images/1832.png) 

Reynold’s published “Sonnet for Retirement” in _The Athenaeum_ in 1832. This poem is a revised version of his original 1820 “Sonnet.”  

It is interesting to consider what it means for the poem to appear in such a venue and the revisions Reynolds made to his 1820 version before he published it. It has been twelve years since he wrote "Sonnet" in _The Fancy_. Yet, the poem seems to allude to a similar commentary on his personal life, especially considering Reynolds's change in writing style and his resolve that he would never become a major poet.  

Also, by considering the context in which the poem was published, Reynolds may be employing his satirical writing style to subtly call out _The Athenaeum’s_ ideological framework and the publication's idealized notions of artistic expression and poetic genius.


## 1905: _The Fancy_, ed. John Masefield,  “Sonnet”

These variants are crucial in understanding how bibliographic codes add breadth to a body of work and its meaning, especially since the linguistic codes within the 1820 and 1905 sonnets are identical.
