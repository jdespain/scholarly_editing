# **Authorial Biography**

Born on September 9, 1794, in Shrewsbury, Reynolds was the second child of five. His father, George Reynolds, was a schoolteacher and his mother, Charlotte Cox Reynolds, had a love of literature, which can be seen in Reynolds at a very early age as he was able to write verse before the age of ten. At the age of 11 he moved to London as his father had accepted a job there. He only attended school though the age of 15 when on his birthday he was pulled out, which was the custom at the time.  

He had many jobs during his lifetime but the biggest two to note are his career working with multiple law firms and editing, writing, and poetry. His style has been described as romanticism and has acquired a lot of his notoriety as being the friend of John Keats and Thomas Hood.  

He married to Eliza Powell Drewe on August 31, 1822. They were together until his death on November 15, 1852. They only had one child together, Lucy, who passed away in 1835 at the age of ten. His first job after school in 1810 was as a junior clerkship in an insurance office called the Amicable Society for Perpetual Insurance.  

In the mid-1810s he was published in Repository of Literature, Arts, and Sciences, Gentleman's Magazine, and Ladies' Museum. He worked as an editor in many different magazines/journals over his career. In 1817 he joined a legal practice with his friend James Rice. He published his last book, Odes and Addresses to Great People, in 1825, which was co-authored by his brother-in-law Thomas Hood.  

After this he only wrote non-literary prose for the magazine Athenaeum and created a few theatrical scripts. “Sonnet to Retirement” was published in _The Athenaeum_ in 1832. During this time, he was going though financial hardships and would eventually go bankrupt in 1838. 

# **Textual History**  

Before we narrow in on the textual history of “Sonnet for Retirement,” it may be helpful to begin pinpointing key information specific to Reynold’s literary style and the biographical context aforementioned pertinent to the time when Reynold’s published the various sonnet versions.  

### _A Satirical Genuis_  

Reynolds's strongest genre was satire. Since childhood, he had written comic and satirical poetry, which for years he “regarded as pieces of diversion” (Jones 304). Reynolds's most familiar work is his satirical masterpiece _Peter Bell_, an “uproarious mockery of William Wordsworth’s faults and limitations” (Jones 304). Leonidas Jones, a well-versed scholar of Reynolds, explains that “satire always depends upon the reader’s knowledge of and interest in what is being satirized. All literate people have potential traces of malice and envy that Reynolds's iconoclasm appeals to in ridiculing in _Peter Bell_ the great poetic god Wordsworth” (Jones 305).  

### _Romanticism_  

Reynolds wrote during the English Romantic period, and his contemporaries included Keats, Coleridge, and Wordsworth. Reynolds’s poetry employed Romantic aesthetics such as an appreciation for nature, perception over reason, the search for the hero and/or genius, nostalgia, death, and the sublime. In addition, he produced many Petrarchan sonnets—a poetic structure he employed for “Sonnet for Retirement.” Instead of providing information on Reynolds’s use of the Petrarchan sonnet in the footnotes of our finalized text—please bear with me—I will try my best to explain below:

</p>  

#### _Reynolds's Petrarchan Sonnet_  

Petrarchan sonnets have their own rhyme scheme and structure. They include two stanzas: an octave, or eight lines, and a sestet, or six lines.  

One key characteristic of Petrarchan sonnets is the “blazon.” The blazon is a poetic mode usually used with literary devices to praise or express adoration for a subject. However, in the case of “Sonnet for Retirement,” the blazon is instead used to place blame or express scorn—most likely on his lack of success and recognition for his work.  

There are many critics who argue Reynolds failed to reach the poetic genius and craft achieved by other Romantic poets:  

> “Reynolds was often a good lyrist-more often than is realized by many who laugh at Hunt for linking his name with Keats and Shelley—but he frequently spoiled his sonnets by paying too little attention to the important closing lines" (Jones, 107).  

In addition to this claim, there are a few more issues present in Reynolds’s sonnet that may be conducive to highlight:  

- In line 10, the final word fails to rhyme with “sees” and “flees”.  

- A Petrarchan sonnet has 15 lines total. However, due to the enjambment in line 7, Reynolds’s poem contains 15 lines.  

- Typically, the octave of a Petrarchan sonnet presents a question, and the sestet attempts to answer. At the end of the octave, leading into the sestet, this shift in subject matter occurs called the “volta.” It seems—however, I may be incorrect—that the shift from “question” to “answer” takes place earlier, in line 3. 
Whether these concerns have authorial intention or inexperience, they are crucial to the work, its meaning, and interpretation.  

In sum, Reynolds’s satirical approach and engagement with Romantic aesthetics are essential to keep in mind while reviewing the transcriptions and their provided footnotes.

### **1820: _The Fancy_, "SONNET."**

</p>  


The 1820 “Sonnet” is the first version of John Hamilton Reynolds's poem “Sonnet for Retirement.”
In 1820, written under one of his pseudonyms, Peter Corcoran, Reynolds published _The Fancy_, a spirited but “fictional” biography of Corcoran.
A scholar of Reynolds, Leonidas M. Jones, offers authorial intention behind Reynold’s _The Fancy_:  

> [Reynolds] pretend[s] to edit the poetic remains of a young law student, Peter, whose addiction to the boxing world had drawn him into moral decay and a premature death, he achieved sharp irony from the clash between the unnamed editor’s moral disapproval and the reader’s realization that Reynold’s true purpose was to celebrate the shade sports he pretended to condemn. (304)

The irony lies, unbeknownst to Reynolds, in the uncanny prediction of his future. Below, you can see various passages pulled from _The Fancy_ to the similarities in Reynolds’s own fate:  

> “The innocent vices of his boyhood, for such they might comparatively be termed, were exchanged for the deeper failings of advanced years: he plunged into the faming and drinking habits of his associates with an enthusiasm strange and dangerous” (xi).  

> “He drank,—he betted,—he sang:—but the patient hour of self-reproach would come … His muse abandoned all hope of achieving anything great or good…” (xviii).  
 
> “It is impossible to contemplate the youth, the talents, the fate of this young man, and not lament that he should not have applied himself to some pursuit steadily, so as to have filled a worthy station in life” (xxvii).  

 
### **1832: _The Athenaeum_, “SONNET FOR RETIREMENT.”**  

<p align="left">
  <img 
    width="300"
    height="300"
    src="https://jdespain.github.io/scholarly_editing/images/1832.png">
</p>  

Reynold’s published “Sonnet for Retirement” in _The Athenaeum_ in 1832. This poem is a revised version of his original 1820 “Sonnet.”  

It is interesting to consider what it means for the poem to appear in such a venue and the revisions Reynolds made to his 1820 version before he published it. It has been twelve years since he wrote "Sonnet" in _The Fancy_. Yet, the poem seems to allude to a similar commentary on his personal life, especially considering Reynolds's change in writing style and his resolve that he would never become a major poet. Further, in _The Fancy_, Reynolds introduces “Sonnet” by sharing the following:  

> "His muse abandoned all hope of achieving anything great or good, he introduces sonnet by stating: and it was with this feeling that he wrote the following Sonnets. When it is recollected that they were composed by a despairing, self-ruined man, they may, to feeling breasts, assume a pathos, though in themselves they may have it not" (xviii-xix).  

Last, by considering the context in which the poem was published, Reynolds may be employing his satirical writing style to subtly call out _The Athenaeum’s_ ideological framework and the publication's idealized notions of artistic expression and poetic genius.


### **1905: _The Fancy_, ed. John Masefield, “Sonnet.”** 
<p align="left">
  <img 
    width="350"
    height="300"
    src="https://jdespain.github.io/scholarly_editing/images/1905_Masefield.png">
</p>  

In his introduction, John Masefield offers reason for the importance of recovering _The Fancy_. He states, “it is strange” _The Fancy_ “should have been so long out of print. It is full of beauty, and wit, and humour, and pathos. Its beauty and wit and pathos have never lacked lovers; and it has been kept in memory, if never reprinted” (22).  

Masefield’s 1905 reprint of _The Fancy_ is ***not*** a scholarly edition. He does not make any textual emendations or offer any textual annotations. Instead, Masefield provides a prefatory memoir with contextual notes. Below, I provide key passages from his introduction that frame Reynolds’s work:
 “Peter Corcoran was Reynolds, the better and poetical self of him. It is that which gives the book such pathetic intensity. It is that which barbs the wit of it, and makes it memorable” (20).  
 
 > “[_The Fancy_ is Reynolds’s] own farewell to the world; his last dying speech and confession; his final parting with his youth, his poetry, the forbidden delights of youth” (19).  
 > 
Before reviewing the sonnet transcriptions, it is important to note a variant in the poem’s textual materiality of Masefield’s 1905 edition.
It is important to note a variant within the bibliographic codes of the 1820 and 1905 sonnet versions necessary to address before reviewing the three sonnet transcriptions: the page layout.  

Below, the 1820 sonnets were printed on two separate pages, with surrounding text visible.

<p align="left">
  <img

    height="400"
    src="https://jdespain.github.io/scholarly_editing/images/1820_Sonnet_PageLayout.png">
</p>  

Below, the sonnets in Masefield’s edition are stacked and printed on the same page, with no additional text visible.  

<p align="left">
  <img 
    width="300"
    height="450"
    src="https://jdespain.github.io/scholarly_editing/images/Masefield_Sonnets.png">
</p>  

In sum, these variants are crucial in understanding how bibliographic codes add breadth to a body of work and its meaning, especially since the linguistic codes within the 1820 and 1905 documents are identical. In regard to textual scholarship, the visual presentation of text can offer new and/or different interpretations as well as suggest variation in authorial intention and textual meaning.

# **Editorial Rationale**  
We took notice of the spelling, capitalization, and punctuation (including indentations). This includes the of apostrophes so that the entire word is spelled out (e.g. wondrous vs. wond’rous), and the adjusting of the capitalization of some words as well as the punctuation (e.g. Posey:— vs. posey—). We also discussed the word differences that appeared between the 1820 and 1832 versions (see chart below to show major word changes).  

We have two different versions of the poem that were published at three separate points in time. Two by Reynolds himself in _The Fancy_ (1820) and in _The Athenaeum_ (1832) and the third by Masefield who was recovering _The Fancy_ (1905). The Masefield version was essentially an exact copy of the 1820 version of the poem with minor changes such as the capitalization of the title. The 1820 title was originally “SONNET” published in _The Fancy_, 1832. _The Athenaeum_ changed the title to “SONNET TO RETIREMENT” and made a few changes on word selection. The 1905 Masefield Edition came back to the original title; however, it was “Sonnet” (as seen in the printings).  

The three texts show different word structure/selection, this can be due to the lack of importance of the poem structure if the words used were in the same stanza. Both _The Fancy_ and Masefield edition share P.C as author signature, but the 1832 version in _The Athenaeum_ is signed by J.H. Reynolds. 


## **Style Guide**
You will see that words have been color-coded in each version of the poem. These denote the textual variants made by Reynolds:   
- <span style="color:red">Red:</span> Word Choice
- <span style="color:orange">Orange:</span> Punctuation
- <span style="color:blue">Blue:</span> Spelling
- <span style="color:purple">Purple:</span> Capitalization  

Alongside the colored codes, you can find corresponding footnotes that further discuss the textual variations, as well as a hypothetical explanation of the authorial intention behind these changes and our interpretation of its alternative meanings.  

Additional footnotes provide either **biographical** or  **historical** or **literary** context, offering you the opportunity for deeper understanding and readings.

### 1832: “SONNET FOR RETIREMENT.”[^1]  
I once had thought to have embalm’d[^2] my name  
    With poesy[^3]—to have served the gentle Muses[^4]  
    With high sincerity;—but life[^5] refuses;—  
And I am now become most strangely tame[^6],  
And careless what becomes of glory’s[^7]: game—  
    Who plays—who wins the wond’ rous prize—  
        who loses:  
Not that the jarring[^8] world my spirit bruises—  
But fate denies the Paradise of Fame[^9]!  

Magnificent and lustrous images  
    Have visited me often-times, and given  
My mind to proud delights—But now it sees  
    Those visions fading like the lights of Even’[^10];  
All intellectual glory dimly flees,  
    And I am silent as the stars of Heaven!  
                                                — J.H. Reynolds[^11]  


[^1]: Reynolds revises his sonnet’s title in 1832 from “Sonnet” to “Sonnet for Retirement.” Reynolds may have found “retirement” to represent the text’s meaning more accurately. In addition, and since The Fancy was a meditation on his own life, framing the 1832 sonnet around its biographical context suggests Reynolds’s updated commentary on his life.  

[^2]: Here, as well as with the word “wond’rous in line 6,” Reynolds employs an elision, most likely to lower the number of syllables in order to adhere to the meter of the Petrarchan sonnet.  

[^3]: “posey” is another term for “poetry.” Not to be confused with “poesy,” a term related to a person attempting to impress others or perceived as pretentious.  

[^4]: The Muses were the Greek goddesses of poetic inspiration, the adored deities of song, dance, and memory, on whose mercy the creativity, wisdom, and insight of all artists and thinkers depended. In his essay, “The Poetry of John Hamilton Reynolds,” Robert Gittings offers context behind Reynold’s view of “The Muses”: “The curious lack of ease, which penetrates even Reynolds's best poems, may perhaps be traced to this family background. It must have been a strong sense of inferiority that led him to write, when only 21 (11), 'I am one of those unfortunate youths to whom the Muse has glanced a sparkling of her light — one of those who pant for distinction, but have not within them that immortal powerwhichalonecancommandit.' In fact, the Muse, which Reynolds invoked so despairingly and renounced so frequently, only to fall into her toils again, was perhaps not that of Poetry but of Parody” (16).    

[^5]: In the 1820 sonnet, Reynolds uses the word “Fate” with a capital “F.” In his 1832 revision, he changes the word to “life,” using a lowercase “l.” Fate is often a term that refers to events beyond human control. Although Reynolds repurposes “fate” in line 9, it’s possible “life” offers personal self-determination, especially when compared to line 4. Reynolds may be indicating agency over his career choice and renounce of vices.  

[^6]: This reference of a “strangely tame” self emphasizes the notion of “life’s refusal” in line 3. By 1832, Reynolds had been in the profession of law for fifteen years and married to Eliza for ten years. John Masefield explains that “Instead of writing poetry [“Peter” aka Reynolds] was to draw leases. Instead of reading poetry he was to read law. instead of going with his friends to talk art, or to watch boxing, he was to sit at home and play cribbage” (19).  

[^7]: The variant presented is a change from uppercase to lowercase—“Glory’s” to “glory’s.” While this could be considered an accidental variant. However, it may actually be a substantive variant by considering authorial intention. Reynolds emendation—capitalization to lower case—the word is no longer regarded as a proper noun. The lowercase “g” relinquishes a sense of power as well as Reynolds’s fascinating need to be honored for his poetic achievements.  

[^8]: Reynolds's word change from “heavy” (1820) to “jarring” (1832) shows a significant change in his poetic craft and engagement with language. Further, compared to “heavy,” “jarring” presents specificity—a concrete, vivid image that offers insight into the disturbing effect Reynolds’s lack of success had on him throughout his life. Refer to lines 10 and 13 for another example of Reynolds’s literary maturity: “mental” (1820) vs. “lustrous” (1832); and “going” (1820) vs. “fading.”  
 
[^9]: This is Reynolds's most significant revision from his 1820 version. Only the first and last words remain the same. The meat of the line is changed from “I have not the heart to rush” to “fate denies the Paradise of.” Reynolds also emends the punctuation: a period to an exclamation point. Here, Reynolds relinquishes the agency he gave himself earlier, suggesting it wasn’t his lack of desire but rather out of his control. In addition, he introduces the word “Paradise,” a term, especially when capitalized, that refers to Heaven (a word he uses in the final line of his sonnet).  

[^10]: Here, Reynolds places an elision at the end of “Even.” This emendation of punctuation proffers clarity: “Even’” is a contraction of “Evening.” Considering the line's context, the text may be possible to interpret; however, it eliminates uncertainty and allows a more straightforward reading.  

[^11]: In 1832, Reynolds credits himself to “Sonnet of Retirement” instead of Corcoran.
