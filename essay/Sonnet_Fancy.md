# **Authorial Biography**

Born on September 9, 1794, in Shrewsbury, Reynolds was the second child of five. His father, George Reynolds, was a schoolteacher and his mother, Charlotte Cox Reynolds, had a love of literature, which can be seen in Reynolds at a very early age as he was able to write verse before the age of ten. At the age of 11 he moved to London as his father had accepted a job there. He only attended school though the age of 15 when on his birthday he was pulled out, which was the custom at the time.  

He had many jobs during his lifetime but the biggest two to note are his career working with multiple law firms and editing, writing, and poetry. His style has been described as romanticism and has acquired a lot of his notoriety as being the friend of John Keats and Thomas Hood.  

He married to Eliza Powell Drewe on August 31, 1822. They were together until his death on November 15, 1852. They only had one child together, Lucy, who passed away in 1835 at the age of ten. His first job after school in 1810 was as a junior clerkship in an insurance office called the Amicable Society for Perpetual Insurance.  

In the mid-1810s he was published in Repository of Literature, Arts, and Sciences, Gentleman's Magazine, and Ladies' Museum. He worked as an editor in many different magazines/journals over his career. In 1817 he joined a legal practice with his friend James Rice. He published his last book, Odes and Addresses to Great People, in 1825, which was co-authored by his brother-in-law Thomas Hood.  

After this he only wrote non-literary prose for the magazine Athenaeum and created a few theatrical scripts. “Sonnet to Retirement” was published in _The Athenaeum_ in 1832. During this time, he was going though financial hardships and would eventually go bankrupt in 1838. 


# **Textual History**  

Before we narrow in on the textual history of “Sonnet for Retirement,” it may be helpful to begin pinpointing key information specific to Reynold’s literary style and the biographical context aforementioned pertinent to the time when Reynold’s published the various sonnet versions.  


### ***A Romantic and Satirical Genuis***  

Reynolds's strongest genre was satire. Since childhood, he had written comic and satirical poetry, which for years he “regarded as pieces of diversion” (Jones 304). Reynolds's most familiar work is his satirical masterpiece _Peter Bell_, an “uproarious mockery of William Wordsworth’s faults and limitations” (Jones 304). Leonidas Jones, a well-versed scholar of Reynolds, explains that “satire always depends upon the reader’s knowledge of and interest in what is being satirized. All literate people have potential traces of malice and envy that Reynolds's iconoclasm appeals to in ridiculing in _Peter Bell_ the great poetic god Wordsworth” (Jones 305).  

Reynolds’s satirical approach and engagement with Romantic aesthetics are essential to keep in mind while reviewing the transcriptions and their provided footnotes.

The 1820 “Sonnet” is the first version of John Hamilton Reynolds's poem “Sonnet for Retirement.”
In 1820, written under one of his pseudonyms, Peter Corcoran, Reynolds published _The Fancy_, a spirited but “fictional” biography of Corcoran.
A scholar of Reynolds, Leonidas M. Jones, offers authorial intention behind Reynold’s _The Fancy_:  

> [Reynolds] pretend[s] to edit the poetic remains of a young law student, Peter, whose addiction to the boxing world had drawn him into moral decay and a premature death, he achieved sharp irony from the clash between the unnamed editor’s moral disapproval and the reader’s realization that Reynold’s true purpose was to celebrate the shade sports he pretended to condemn. (304)

The irony lies, unbeknownst to Reynolds, in the uncanny prediction of his future. Below, you can see various passages pulled from _The Fancy_ to the similarities in Reynolds’s own fate:

### **1832: _The Athenaeum_, “Sonnet for Retirement.”**

</p>  

Reynold’s published “Sonnet for Retirement” in _The Athenaeum_ in 1832. This poem is a revised version of his original 1820 “Sonnet.”  

It is interesting to consider what it means for the poem to appear in such a venue and the revisions Reynolds made to his 1820 version before he published it. It has been twelve years since he wrote "Sonnet" in _The Fancy_. Yet, the poem seems to allude to a similar commentary on his personal life, especially considering Reynolds's change in writing style and his resolve that he would never become a major poet.  

Also, by considering the context in which the poem was published, Reynolds may be employing his satirical writing style to subtly call out _The Athenaeum’s_ ideological framework and the publication's idealized notions of artistic expression and poetic genius.

## ***Material Textuality***  

Last, there is a varient within the bibliographic codes of the 1820 and 1832 sonnets necessary to address before reviewing the three sonnet transcriptions. It seems easier to address them here than in the footnotes, and are delineated below:  


### Page Layout  


#### **1820 "SONNET."**
In _The Fancy_, the two sonnets

These variants are crucial in understanding how bibliographic codes add breadth to a body of work and its meaning, especially since the linguistic codes within the 1820 and 1905 sonnets are identical.
